To run the code, first open up daemon.py and run "python daemon.py". Username and password should be specified in the file already.

Next up, open monitor.py and run "python monitor.py 127.0.0.1". 127.0.0.1 specifies the localhost. Username and password should be the same as daemon, the FTP server. After inputting username and password, choose the directory to track. Please note that I have used files as my directory to track and backup as the FTP server's "backup". Input the entire file path of the directory.

P.S: Make sure any program making use of Port 21 should be deactivated before you can run the daemon.py file. In XAMPP, FileZilla usually makes use of Port 21, so be sure to check that out.
